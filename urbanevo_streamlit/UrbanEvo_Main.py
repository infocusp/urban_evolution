    """
    Forecasting of urbanization can be a challenging task and can be crucial for urban development, healthcare, education etc. 
    Global trends may show varying population growth in different regions and there might be multiple factors affecting this. 
    Hence, predicting the growth of urban areas can be a bit tricky using the traditional statistical methods. 

    **Urban-Evo model predicts the probability of urbanization across locations over the next five year period.**
    It uses geospatial climatic, vegatation & population growth data from earth engine to predict urbanization.""")
